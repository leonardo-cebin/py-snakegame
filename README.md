<h2>Retro Snake Game</h2>
<h5>a.k.a. Jogo da Cobrinha</h5>

Feeling retro yet? Here's a complete Snake game inspired by the classic Nokia cellphone game that was a hit in the 2000s. Control the initial speed and size of your snake, and try to set a new record. Eat the food to grow without limits, but beware of your tailâ€”it will get closer to you with every meal. Every so often, a special food will appear randomly, allowing you to earn points without growing.

All game sprites were made by myself.

Easter Eggs included ;)
