<h2>Retro Snake Game</h2>
<h5>a.k.a. Jogo da Cobrinha</h5>

Feeling retro yet? Here it is. A complete Snake Game inspired by the classic NOKIA cellphone game that was a hit in the 00s. Control the initial speed and size of this little snake, and try to set the record. Eat the food and grow without limits, but beware of your tail, it will be closer to you after every meal. Once in a while a new special food will appear randomly, allowing you to win points without growing.

All game sprites were made by myself.

Easter Eggs included ;)
